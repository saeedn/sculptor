# Update the Product Specs

Reconcile the spec set under `docs/specs/` with everything merged to `origin/main` since the specs
were last refreshed. The job has two halves: **(1) review the new commits, decide what changed about
the product, and edit the docs to match** (Steps 2–6), and **(2) confirm every claim already in the
docs is still true of the current code** (Step 7) — because a standing claim can rot from a change the
commit review correctly skips as noise (a deletion, a rename, a moved default). Do not invent behavior,
and do not document implementation detail the product docs deliberately omit.

## The doc set

`docs/specs/` holds four long-lived, related documents. Read `docs/specs/README.md` first — it is the
authority on how they relate. In brief:

| Doc | What it captures | When a change touches it |
|---|---|---|
| `SPEC.md` | The narrative product spec: what Sculptor is and how each feature **behaves**, in prose. | A new/changed user-facing capability or behavior. |
| `requirements.md` | The measurable & contractual facts the prose omits: numeric targets, version/platform bars, persistence/migration guarantees, integration contracts, open questions. (This is the "architecture/requirements" doc — there is no separate `architecture.md`.) | A change that sets or moves a number, a version floor, a contract, or a guarantee. |
| `scenarios.md` | Every user-facing interaction as a Given/When/Then scenario with a stable `AREA-NNN` ID. | A change to what happens **on screen** for any interaction. |
| `scenario_coverage.md` | Maps each scenario to the integration test that demonstrates it (Complete / Partial / Missing). | Any scenario you add, change, or remove — and any new/changed test that moves a scenario's status. |

Discover the docs dynamically (`ls docs/specs/*.md`) rather than hard-coding the list, so the skill
still works if a doc is added or renamed. Apply the per-doc guidance above by matching the doc's role,
not its exact filename.

## Step 1: Determine the baseline commit

The baseline is the commit the specs were last reconciled against. Everything after it is unreviewed.

1. If the user passed a commit as `$ARGUMENTS`, use that.
2. Else read `docs/specs/.spec-baseline` — a file holding the baseline SHA on its first line. Use that SHA.

```bash
head -1 docs/specs/.spec-baseline
```

If the file is missing, stop and tell the user — the baseline must be seeded first (write the last
reconciliation commit's SHA to `docs/specs/.spec-baseline`). Don't guess a baseline.

Then fetch and confirm where the baseline sits relative to the current tip:

```bash
git fetch origin --quiet
git rev-parse origin/main
git merge-base --is-ancestor <baseline> origin/main && echo "baseline on main" || echo "WARN: baseline not on main"
git rev-list --count <baseline>..origin/main
```

If the baseline is not an ancestor of `origin/main`, stop and ask the user how to proceed (it may be on
a feature branch or have been rebased away). Reconcile **against `origin/main`**, not the local HEAD,
unless the user says otherwise.

## Step 2: Enumerate the merged PRs since the baseline

This repo merges with no-fast-forward, so every PR is one merge commit on the first-parent spine. Use
the **merge commits as the source of truth** for what landed, and the non-merge subjects for detail.

```bash
# Source of truth — one line per merged PR:
git log <baseline>..origin/main --merges --first-parent --format='%h %s'
# Detail — individual commit subjects, for understanding each PR:
git log <baseline>..origin/main --no-merges --format='%s'
```

If the lists are large, write them to the scratchpad and read them with the Read tool rather than
scrolling shell output.

## Step 3: Separate product changes from noise

Most commits do **not** change the product and must not trigger spec edits — but **classify from the
diff, not the subject.** A subject and branch name describe *intent* ("cleanup", "flake fix", "build");
the spec cares about *effect*, and the two diverge exactly where it matters: a "cleanup" PR that
removes a documented feature, a "flake fix" that changes behavior. So before you can call a PR noise,
look at **what files it touched** — this is cheap:

```bash
# File list per PR — the real classification signal. Read this, not just the subject.
git show --stat <merge-sha>
# Or stat the whole range at once, one block per PR:
git log <baseline>..origin/main --first-parent --stat --format='### %h %s'
```

**Three hard escalation triggers. A PR hitting any of these gets its diff read no matter how its
subject reads — it cannot be dismissed as noise on the subject alone:**

- **Deletions & renames.** Any PR that deletes or renames a file
  (`git log <baseline>..origin/main --diff-filter=D,R --name-status`). A removal is the change most
  likely to be *both* filed as noise *and* to invalidate a standing doc claim — grep the docs for the
  removed path/symbol before letting it pass. (This is the class that kept a deleted helper script in
  the docs for multiple runs.)
- **Product-surface paths.** The diff touches `frontend/src/pages/**` or `frontend/src/components/**`,
  a web route handler, `config/user_config.py` (settings/defaults), a `*/registry.py`, a `sculpt` CLI
  command file, a keybindings map, or add-repo / settings-panel code — regardless of
  subject.
- **Non-test source under a test/flake subject.** A "flake fix" or "test" PR whose diff includes
  **non-test product files** is a behavior change wearing a test-fix label. Read the non-test files.

**Genuine noise — skip only when the *diff* confirms it, never on the subject:**

- Comment scrubs and rewording.
- Dependency upgrades (Electron/Node/Python/React/Vite/etc.) and lockfile refreshes.
- CI / build / release plumbing (release gating, telemetry-key injection, apt-get hardening, CI concurrency, pyre-cache ignore).
- **Test-only** changes — the diff touches *nothing but* tests / test infra (`*_test.py`, `test_*.py`,
  `*.test.ts(x)`, fixtures). (Exception: a test-only PR can still move a `scenario_coverage.md` status
  — see Step 6.)
- Style-guide / review-rule / internal-doc edits, version bumps, frozen-schema regeneration.

**For everything not cleanly noise, apply the inclusion test** from the spec's scope discipline:

> Would a user **see**, **name**, or **configure** this? If yes, it likely belongs in the product docs.

New capabilities, new settings, new panels/screens, changed defaults, changed keybindings, new CLI
flags, changed error/reliability behavior a user would notice, and removed features all qualify.

**Keep implementation detail OUT of the product docs.** Internal services, the task/Environment
substrate, WebSocket/HTTP transport, Alembic/DB migrations, schema regen, and similar plumbing are
impl-only — they belong (if anywhere) in `requirements.md` as a contract, never as product narrative.

The signal-to-noise ratio is typically ~10:1 (≈15 product features out of ≈80 PRs). Treat that as an
**observation to sanity-check against, not a quota to prune toward** — classify each PR by its effect
and let the count land where it lands. A list far *larger* than that means impl detail is probably
leaking in; far *smaller* means you're likely trusting subjects over diffs. When a call is genuinely
uncertain, bias toward **reading the diff**, not toward skipping.

## Step 4: Understand each product change

Branch names embed ticket IDs (`scu-NNNN`) and squashed subjects are descriptive, but **do not write
spec text from the subject line alone** — it describes the fix, not the resulting behavior. Step 3
already gave you each PR's file list; now read the **real change** for everything you kept (and for any
escalation-trigger PR you're still unsure about):

```bash
git log <merge-sha>^1..<merge-sha>^2 --format='%s'   # the PR's own commits
git diff <merge-sha>^1..<merge-sha> -- <relevant paths>   # the real change → the resulting behavior
```

**Group related PRs into one feature** before editing (e.g. a dozen plugin-system PRs are one new
product surface, not a dozen edits). Decide, per feature, the *current* user-visible behavior — what
the product does now, on main — because that is what the spec must describe.

## Step 5: Plan the edits

For each feature, decide which docs are affected and what each edit is. This is mostly a straight
translation from "what the commits changed" to "what the product now does" — **don't check in with the
user for routine edits.** Make the changes and let the user review the diff at the end (Step 9).

Only pause to ask the user when there is **genuine ambiguity you cannot resolve from the code and
docs** — e.g. a default changed but you can't tell which value is now authoritative, or it's unclear
whether a feature is shipped vs. gated behind an experimental flag and the code doesn't say. Resolve
everything you can on your own first (read the code, read the surrounding doc); ask only about what's
truly left over, and batch those questions rather than interrupting per-feature.

## Step 6: Apply the edits

Edit each doc in place, **matching its established format, tone, and structure**. Read enough
surrounding context in each doc to slot the change in where it belongs, not at the end.

**Describe what the code does today — never what it used to do.** These are living descriptions of the
current product, not a changelog. Don't leave a trace of the change: no "now …", "no longer …",
"previously …", "used to …", "formerly …", "renamed from …", "instead of …", or any before/after
phrasing. The commit history already records what changed; the doc records what *is*. When you revise a
section, rewrite it so a reader with no knowledge of the old behavior gets an accurate, self-contained
description — then delete any wording that only makes sense relative to the past.

- **`SPEC.md`** — prose behavior. Add to or revise the relevant feature section; remove text for
  removed features. Keep the descriptive, present-tense product voice. Experimental/off-by-default
  features go in the experimental section, marked as such.
- **`requirements.md`** — only when the change sets or moves a measurable target, version/platform
  bar, persistence/migration guarantee, integration contract, or resolves an open question. Don't
  restate prose here; record the *fact*.
- **`scenarios.md`** — Given/When/Then with a stable `AREA-NNN` ID. **Preserve the ID scheme**: reuse
  the right area prefix (see its "Areas / ID prefixes" table), and **assign the next free number in
  that area — never renumber existing scenarios**. Every Then must be visible on screen. Delete
  scenarios for removed behavior; revise in place for changed behavior.
- **`scenario_coverage.md`** — for every scenario you added/changed/removed, add/update/remove its
  coverage row, set status (Complete / Partial / Missing) by checking whether an integration test
  actually drives the action and asserts the visible outcome, and **update the per-area counts in the
  executive summary table** so the totals stay consistent. A test-only PR that newly covers an
  existing scenario can move a status here even though no other doc changes.

**Public-visibility rule:** these docs are world-readable. Scrub PII, internal hostnames/service
names, customer data, and security-sensitive detail, per CLAUDE.md's "Public Visibility" section.

## Step 7: Verify the docs against the code — every claim, baseline-independent

Steps 2–6 are *changelog-driven*: they translate the new commits into edits. That has a structural
blind spot — a claim **already in the docs** can be silently invalidated by a change you correctly
filtered out as noise in Step 3 (most often a **deletion or rename** buried in a "cleanup" / "build"
PR). The changelog will never surface it, because as a *commit* it isn't a product change; only its
*effect* on a standing claim is. (This is exactly how a deleted helper script lived on in
`requirements.md` for multiple runs.)

So this step ignores the commit history entirely. It treats the docs as a set of **standing
assertions** and confirms each one is true of the code **as it is right now**. It is **not scoped by
the baseline** and **not limited to the sections you edited** — a claim you didn't touch this run is
exactly where rot hides. **Every factual statement in all four docs is a claim to confirm true.**

Claim categories, and how to verify each:

- **Existence** — a named file, module, function, class, test, script, binary, env var, CLI command,
  setting, registration, or flag. → Confirm it still exists in the tree. This is the cheap backstop;
  always run it:
  ```bash
  # Pull backtick-quoted paths/symbols from the prose docs; report any with no match in the tree.
  for d in docs/specs/SPEC.md docs/specs/requirements.md; do grep -oE '`[^`]+`' "$d"; done \
    | tr -d '`' \
    | grep -oE '[A-Za-z0-9_./-]+\.(py|ts|tsx|toml|json|sh|plist)|[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]{4,}' \
    | sort -u > /tmp/spec-refs.txt
  while read -r r; do
    git grep -qI -- "$r" -- sculptor tools 2>/dev/null || ls "$r" >/dev/null 2>&1 || echo "UNVERIFIED: $r"
  done < /tmp/spec-refs.txt
  ```
  Triage: runtime/on-disk paths (`~/.sculptor/internal/…`) and doc-internal IDs (`AREA-NNN`,
  `REQ-…`, `SECURITY.md`) are false positives; a real code path/symbol that's gone is a stale claim.
- **Value** — a number, limit, default, version/platform bar, timeout, keybinding, enum value, or
  exact UI label/string. → Grep the authoritative source and confirm the value matches: the version
  window in `managed_tools.py`, a size limit in the `*Utils.ts` constant, a default in
  `user_config.py`, a button's literal text in its component. A doc that pins `20 MB` must equal the
  constant.
- **Behavior** — "clicking X does Y", every scenario's **Then**, every "the product does Z" sentence.
  → Find the implementing code and confirm it still does that. This is the expensive part — fan it out
  (below).
- **Contract / guarantee** — persistence & migration survival, platform support, integration failure
  modes, isolation/security boundaries. → Confirm the mechanism still exists and behaves as stated.
- **Absence / scoping** — "only when …", "not gated on …", "removed", "no longer offered". These rot
  silently after a refactor. → Confirm the negative actually holds: the gate is where the doc says it
  is, and a thing described as removed is really gone *everywhere*.

**Make it tractable by fanning out.** You cannot deeply re-derive ~4700 lines of claims inline. Slice
the doc set into coherent units (by SPEC subsection, requirements section, and scenario area) and
dispatch a **read-only** agent per slice (the `Explore` agent fits) — in parallel. Hand each agent its
slice verbatim and require it to return, per claim, only a verdict:

- **confirmed** — with the `file:line` that proves it,
- **refuted** — with the contradicting code, or
- **uncertain** — implementation not found.

Bias the agents toward skepticism: *confirmed* requires finding the code and seeing it match, not that
the claim merely sounds plausible. Don't let an agent infer behavior from the doc itself.

**Act on the verdicts:**

- **Refuted** → fix the doc like any other edit (Step 6 rules: describe what *is*, no changelog
  wording). A refuted claim usually means a feature was removed, a default moved, or a label changed
  with no product-flagged PR.
- **Uncertain** → investigate yourself; if still unresolved, **flag it in the handback** (Step 9). Never
  silently leave a claim you could not confirm.

## Step 8: Verify internal consistency, then record the new baseline

Cross-check that the docs still agree **with each other**:

- Every new/changed `scenarios.md` ID has a matching `scenario_coverage.md` row, and the per-area and
  total summary counts add up (sum the area rows; they must equal the totals).
- A feature added to `SPEC.md` is referenced consistently wherever else it's mentioned (CLI table,
  settings list, experimental section, etc.) — grep the doc for the feature's name.
- No implementation-only detail leaked into the product narrative.

Then **update the baseline pointer** so the next run's *changelog review* starts here:

```bash
git rev-parse origin/main > docs/specs/.spec-baseline
```

## Step 9: Hand back, don't commit

Leave the working tree dirty for the user to review — do **not** commit or push (matching the other
doc-update skills). Summarize what you changed: the baseline range reviewed (`<baseline>..<tip>`, with
counts), the features that drove edits, the docs touched, the new baseline SHA recorded, and anything
you intentionally skipped. Report the **claim-verification pass (Step 7)** separately: roughly how many
claims you checked, every **refuted** claim you fixed (with what was wrong), and every **uncertain**
claim you could not confirm — the user needs the uncertains called out explicitly, not buried.

## Notes for recurring runs

- `.spec-baseline` scopes the **changelog review** (Steps 2–6) so each run only re-reads *new*
  commits. It does **not** scope the **claim-verification pass** (Step 7) — that re-confirms the whole
  doc set every run, on purpose. Don't "optimize" Step 7 down to only the touched sections or the
  baseline range; the rot it catches (a claim invalidated by a filtered-out deletion) is invisible to
  the changelog by definition. If cost is a concern, parallelize the fan-out — don't shrink the scope.
- Scale the *changelog* effort to the range: a week of commits is a quick pass; a multi-month gap
  (like the first run) is a large review — work through it feature-group by feature-group. The Step 7
  verification cost is roughly constant regardless of range, and usually dominates a small run.
- This skill reviews and edits docs; it never changes product code or tests.
