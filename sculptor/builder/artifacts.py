"""This module defines where artifact files are uploaded once the build process completes.

This module contains type definitions specifying the Target Platform and Architecture,
the Package type and the locations in S3 where these can be found.

The key function of this module is:

`artifacts_for_target_and_stage()` which returns the targets as a list of ArtifactFiles.

An ArtifactFile specifies an origin file to a list of destination files. Once
the build process completes, this module can be used to determine which local
files should be copied, and to what destinations.


If you add a new artifact file to the build process, you should add it to the maps below.
