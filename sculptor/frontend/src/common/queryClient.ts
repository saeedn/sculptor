 * stale) with the default `refetchOnMount: true` (so an observer mounting on
 * a query that was *explicitly* invalidated while unobserved — e.g. a tab
 * regaining focus after an agent commit invalidated its caches — picks up
 * the fresh data on first paint). Window-focus and reconnect refetches are
 * off because the WS stream covers those.
