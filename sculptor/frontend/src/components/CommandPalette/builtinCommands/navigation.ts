/**
 * Top-level navigation entries are *curated*, not registry-driven.
 *
 * The router (`Router.tsx`) owns several top-level paths — `/`, `/home`,
 * `/settings`, `/ws/:workspaceID`, and the new-workspace flow. Most of
 * those deliberately do NOT get a Cmd+K row: workspace and agent routes
 * are surfaced by dynamic providers, and the new-workspace flow is
 * reached through `nav.new_workspace` below rather than a separate
 * "Open new workspace" entry.
 *
 * That means there is no useful "every route has a palette command"
 * drift test — a test like that would either be wrong (forcing palette
 * entries for routes that shouldn't have them) or curated by hand, in
 * which case the registry just tests itself. When you add a new
 * top-level route in `Router.tsx`, decide explicitly whether it
 * deserves a row here and add one if so.
