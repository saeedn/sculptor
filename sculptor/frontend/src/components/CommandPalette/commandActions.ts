 * `useKeybindingHandler` (or a raw keydown listener), so the binding and
 * the palette converge on a single function instead of going through a
 * synthesized KeyboardEvent.
 *
 * The map keys are the actions the palette exposes — they don't
 * mirror keybinding ids 1:1 because some palette commands could one day
 * point at actions with no shortcut.
