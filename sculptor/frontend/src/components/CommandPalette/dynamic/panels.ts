/**
 * Surfaces one Cmd+K command per registered IDE panel — Files,
 * Actions, Terminal, and any future panel that gets added to
 * `workspacePanels` / `panelRegistryAtom`. Each command toggles that panel's visibility via
 * `usePanelActions().togglePanel`, which handles open / switch-active /
 * close-zone correctly even when several panels share a zone.
 *
 * Driving these off the registry (instead of hardcoding a static list)
 * means a new panel only needs an entry in `workspacePanels` to
 * appear in the palette — no cross-cutting changes to this file or the
 * builtin command list.
 *
 * Visibility:
 *   - Scoped to the `view.panels` sub-page so the root list isn't
 *     dominated by N "Toggle X" rows. The user opens the page via
 *     "Toggle panel visibility..." (see builtinCommands/panels.ts).
 *   - The palette closes after each toggle rather than using
 *     `keepOpen: true`. Mounting a heavy panel (e.g. the file browser)
 *     while the palette is still on screen makes the toggle feel
 *     noticeably laggier than toggling via the topbar button. Closing
 *     first lets the panel mount alone, matching the mouse-toggle latency.
 *
 * Ranking:
 *   - `boost` lifts these rows above same-tier Settings sub-page entries
 *     that share their name. Without it, typing "Actions" surfaces
 *     "Settings: Actions" (exact title match, score 1000 → 250 after
 *     the page-scoped penalty) above "Toggle Actions" (word-prefix
 *     match, 200 → 50 after penalty). The boost reverses that so the
 *     panel toggle leads. Settings entries still appear, just below.
