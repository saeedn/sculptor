 *   - **Title Case** is reserved for group `heading`s in `groups.ts`,
 *     which are categorical labels rather than commands.
 *
 * Examples:
 *   ✓ "Open settings", "Toggle bottom panel", "Show keyboard shortcuts"
 *   ✓ "Open in Finder", "Open in VS Code"  (proper nouns kept)
 *   ✗ "Open Settings", "Toggle Bottom Panel"

 * Modern editor / launcher UIs (VS Code, Linear, Raycast) follow this
