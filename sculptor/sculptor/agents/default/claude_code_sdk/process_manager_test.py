    ``process_input_message``). After a restart during an in-flight,
    AskUserQuestion-bearing turn, the runner can re-deliver an already-consumed
    answer whose original question no longer exists: on resume the CLI re-issues
    the dangling question under a *new* ``tool_use_id``, so the stale answer
    matches no pending MCP call. ``_try_deliver_answer_to_mcp`` therefore bails,
    and the old behaviour fell through to the respawn guard and raised
    ``IllegalOperationError`` while the worker thread was still parked on the
    re-issued question — wedging the task (``outcome=RUNNING`` with no live
    process, Stop a no-op; the same RUNNING-but-wedged family as SCU-1404 /
    SCU-1405).

    A question-answer that matches no pending question can never be the start of
    a fresh turn (an answer is not a prompt), so the fix discards it — emitting
    ``RequestSkippedAgentMessage`` so the runner's in-flight bookkeeping and the
    frontend's chat message both resolve — instead of respawning or raising.
