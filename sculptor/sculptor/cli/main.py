"""Pre-import bootstrap for the Sculptor backend.

The canonical ``python -m sculptor.cli.main`` and the ``sculptor``
console-script entry point.  Two responsibilities:

1. **Helper-mode dispatch.**  When invoked with ``--pty-helper`` as
   the first argument, this process is a pty-spawning helper
   subprocess (see ``services/.../environments/pty_helper.py``).
   We dispatch into the helper before any heavy backend import runs,
   so the helper interpreter stays small and starts fast.  In the
   PyInstaller bundle ``sys.executable`` is ``sculptor_backend``
   itself; re-entering the same binary with ``--pty-helper`` is the
   only way to launch the helper without shipping a second
   interpreter.

2. **Normal backend startup.**  When no helper flag is present, hand
   off to ``sculptor.cli.app:entrypoint`` which contains the full
   typer CLI and uvicorn startup.  The heavy imports (typer, uvicorn,
   loguru, ``sculptor.web.app``) deliberately live in that module,
   not here, so a helper invocation never pays for them.

Imports above ``main()`` MUST stay stdlib-only.  The property test
in ``main_test.py`` pins the discipline.

    Hand-rolled rather than going through typer so viztracer can be started
    BEFORE the heavy ``cli/app`` import — this is what lets the trace include
    backend import durations and pre-server-startup work.

    Consuming the flag from ``sys.argv`` is load-bearing: typer's grammar is
    ``[OPTIONS] [PROJECT] COMMAND [ARGS]...``, so a ``--trace-to=...`` that
    appears AFTER the positional project path would be mis-parsed as an
    unknown subcommand and abort startup. Removing it here lets the flag
    appear anywhere on the command line.

    Raises ``SystemExit`` if the flag is present with no value (e.g. as the
    final argv entry) so the user gets an immediate error rather than a
    silent no-op.
