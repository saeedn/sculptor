# Think twice before using SculptorSettings directly. We want to be sure to properly inject different settings at test time.
# This is done either by:
#   - Using settings at service collection creation. (All services should take settings values from there, if they need any.)
#   - Using the `get_settings` dependency in FastAPI endpoints.
