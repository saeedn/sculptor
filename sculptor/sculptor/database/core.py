"""
Define core database functionality for the application.

Initial design decisions:
    - We are going to use a subset of SQLAlchemy.
        - Mostly just for table definitions, DB management and query building.
        - Specifically, we're not going to use the ORM features of SQLAlchemy.
        - Reason: we think that ORMs are too heavy-handed and opaque.
        - Also, with an ORM, we lose control over the exposed DB operations.
            - (Having a limited set of specialized functions makes the intended use of the DB clearer.)
    - Each object type is stored in a single mutable table keyed by ``object_id``.
        - Writes upsert (INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE); reads select the row.
        - This setup is achieved through the `database/automanaged.py` module.
