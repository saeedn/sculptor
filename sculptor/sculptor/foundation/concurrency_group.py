"""
This module implements the concept of a Concurrency Group.

Motivation: With how heavily we use threads and processes (collectively called "strands") in Sculptor, it's easy to accidentally leak them
and hard to shut them down gracefully in an organized manner. That can lead to all sorts of hard to debug problems and race conditions.
We would like to have an easy to use mechanism to manage threads and processes in a structured way.

The idea for ConcurrencyGroups is that:
    - Similarly to the DataTransaction concept, ConcurrencyGroups are propagated through the code from the top level downwards.
    - ConcurrencyGroups can be nested, effectively forming a tree structure with one root for the whole application.
    - You should create threads and processes through the current ConcurrencyGroup.
    - A ConcurrencyGroup, being a context manager, does basic accounting of its threads and processes upon exiting.
    - Errors are raised if we forget to join threads or processes, or handle their failures.
    - When shutting down the whole application, the shutdown event is propagated to all threads and processes through the concurrency group tree.
    - Parent errors propagate to children and even to strands so that we know that the whole context we run in is in a failed state.
