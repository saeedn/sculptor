        - A shutdown event initiated by the "owner" of this event.

    From the perspective of threads and processes, they don't care where the shutdown event came from.
    But we need to distinguish between them - we may want to only trigger a shutdown for a particular part of the codebase

    This is effectively a tree of shutdown events where each node can be triggered by its parent or by itself.
