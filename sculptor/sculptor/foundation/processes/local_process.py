"""
Defines 3 main functions for interacting with processes:
- run_blocking: Runs a command and waits for it to complete, returning all output at once.
- run_streaming: Runs a command and waits for it to complete, calling a callback for each line of output as it's produced.
- run_background: Starts a command in the background, returning a RunningProcess object to manage it and access output via a queue.

Avoid using the builtin subprocess module directly; use these functions instead for consistent behavior.

Examples of errors avoided by these wrappers:
- Blocking indefinitely on process output if the output buffer fills up.
- Inconsistent handling of stdout/stderr output.
- Difficulty interrupting long-running processes cleanly.
- Processing streaming output in real-time.
