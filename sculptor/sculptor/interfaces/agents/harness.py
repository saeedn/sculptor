"""The harness-agnostic seam — the interface a harness implements.

A `Harness` is the boundary between Sculptor's generic agent layer and a
specific agent-process implementation. The base interface carries only
what every harness-agnostic consumer reads polymorphically:

- *minimum* — `name`.
- *capability* — two coexisting shapes (PHASE_5_NORTH_STAR §2):
  bool-field capabilities live on `HarnessCapabilities` and are reached
  via `Harness.capabilities()`; gated methods stay on the ABC with
  trivial-answer defaults for protocol-level per-call questions no
  bool can express.
- *polymorphic helpers* — `get_jsonl_path_for_working_directory`,
  `get_tasks_path`. Both return `None` by default; harnesses with an
  on-disk session layout override them.

Concrete-harness addresses (binary key, session-directory name, MCP
identifiers, lifecycle-hook callback id, system-prompt content, etc.) are
*not* on the base — they live on the concrete harness that owns them.
Claude-side code (`ClaudeProcessManager`, `BtwProcessManager`,
`ClaudeOutputProcessor`, `SculptorMcpServer`, `process_manager_utils`)
holds a `ClaudeCodeHarness` reference and reads those members directly.

Agent construction lives on the registry (`harness_registry.py`), which
owns each harness↔agent factory pair. With the registry owning
construction, the original harness↔agent import cycle does not exist,
and `ClaudeCodeSDKAgent` may declare its `harness` field as
`ClaudeCodeHarness`. See architecture §1.1, §1.5.

    Fields have **no Python defaults** — every constructor must list every
    field. When a new capability lands, pydantic validation forces an edit

    the harness↔capability matrix is grep-complete: `grep <field>` finds
    every harness's stance.

    reset is the `/clear` path that discards the session; compaction summarizes
    the session in place at a threshold. They gate different surfaces.
