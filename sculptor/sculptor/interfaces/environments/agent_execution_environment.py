    This protocol defines the methods that agents need to interact with their

    Key features:
    - Path management with per-task namespacing for state and artifacts
    - File operations for reading/writing within the environment
    - Process execution for running commands
    - Terminal management for interactive sessions

    - get_state_path(): Per-task state directory: {root}/state/tasks/{task_id}/
    - get_artifacts_path(): Per-task artifacts directory: {root}/artifacts/tasks/{task_id}/
