"""In-process coordinator that turns PrPollingService observations into
babysitter agent prompts.

The coordinator subscribes to the existing PrPollingService observer
queue, runs a pure transition classifier on each PrStatusInfo update,
and (for actionable transitions) ensures a per-workspace "CI Babysitter"
task exists and delivers the user-configured prompt via
``task_service.create_message``.

In-memory state; the babysitter task itself
is a regular Task row and is fully persistent.
