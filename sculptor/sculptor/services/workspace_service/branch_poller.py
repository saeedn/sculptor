"""Per-workspace git state detection, owned by ``WorkspaceService``.

This watches each live workspace's git state and fans two signals out to
subscriber queues:

- the **current branch** of the workspace's ``HEAD`` (genuinely workspace-scoped:
  every worktree has its own ``HEAD``), which also drives a side effect —
  regenerating the diff when the branch changes out from under us; and
- the workspace's **target branches** (the merge/diff candidates the selector
  offers), projected from the repo's remote-tracking branches, falling back to
  local branches minus the workspace's own when the repo has no remote.

Remote-tracking refs are a property of the *repo*, not the workspace, so they are
scanned once per **common git dir** and reused across every workspace sharing it.
Workspaces are worktrees of their project and share the project repo's common git
dir, so keying the scan on that common dir fetches the project repo's
remote-tracking refs exactly once and reuses them across all of its worktrees.

Both scans are stat-first: a cycle stats the relevant ref files (``HEAD`` for the
branch; ``packed-refs`` + ``refs/remotes`` for the targets) and only reads/forks
``git`` when a signature actually moved, so an idle cycle forks nothing. A
periodic forced recompute covers ref-mutation shapes that leave the signature
unchanged (e.g. a loose ref being packed).

Results are fanned out as ``WorkspaceBranchInfo`` / ``WorkspaceTargetBranchesInfo``
— the same streaming types as before — so the downstream stream conversion and
PR-polling coupling are unchanged. A single loop serves the whole process;
websocket connections subscribe rather than each starting their own pollers.
