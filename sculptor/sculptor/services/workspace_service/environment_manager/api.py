    Internal component for managing environment lifecycle.

    This class is an implementation detail of WorkspaceService and should not be
    accessed directly from outside the workspace_service module.

    Environments are created directly from project paths - no image concept needed
    since we work directly in the user's repository.

    This class will automatically clean up any previous environments when it is started.
    This is required for correctness in the face of hard crashes or unexpected shutdowns.
