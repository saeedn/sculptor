"""Agent-scoped PTY sessions for terminal agents.

A terminal agent owns one PTY, registered in the shared terminal-manager
registry under ``agent:<task_id>`` — a readable, collision-free key beside
the 16-hex-char workspace terminal ids. The manager is constructed with the
workspace's *environment id*, so ``stop_terminals_for_environment`` remains
the teardown backstop.

The config registry mirrors ``register_environment_config`` in
``local_terminal_manager.py``: the task handler registers an
`AgentTerminalConfig` up front so the PTY can be (re)created on demand —
eagerly by the handler, and again by the terminal WebSocket route after a
shell self-exit.
