"""The terminal-agent task handler.

Terminal agents have no chat: the handler acquires the workspace
environment, spawns an agent-scoped PTY running a login shell in the
workspace code directory, and then simply keeps the task RUNNING for the
agent's lifetime while periodically refreshing the workspace diff. There is
no message-queue subscription, no title generation, no artifact sync, no
snapshotting — Sculptor never parses the shell's output.

The task ends only via shutdown/archive/delete (`UserPausedTaskError`, which
the task-service runner maps to QUEUED — or DELETED when archiving). A shell
self-exit does NOT end the task: the WebSocket route respawns the PTY on the
next connection.
