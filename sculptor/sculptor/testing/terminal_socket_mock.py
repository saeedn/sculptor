"""Capture the terminal WebSockets the app opens, so tests can drop them.

Playwright cannot close an already-established loopback WebSocket from a test
(offline emulation does not drop loopback sockets, and ``route_web_socket``
needs its shim injected at document load). To exercise the terminal's
reconnect/connection-state behaviour we instead wrap the global ``WebSocket``
constructor via ``add_init_script`` so every terminal socket the *real* app
creates is recorded on ``window.__terminalSockets``. A test can then close the
live socket with a chosen code and assert how the UI reacts.

The init script is gated on a ``localStorage`` flag so non-terminal tests
sharing the page are unaffected, and ``install()`` / ``uninstall()`` toggle the
flag and reload.

No production code is involved — the wrapper only observes the sockets the app
already opens (and forwards construction to the real ``WebSocket`` via a
``Proxy``, preserving statics like ``WebSocket.OPEN`` and ``instanceof``).
