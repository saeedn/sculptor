Session token middleware for CSRF protection.

Third-party web pages could in theory send POST requests to our API endpoints when Sculptor runs on localhost.
We prevent that using the SessionTokenMiddleware, which requires a shared session token to be sent in a custom header.
The session token is generated when the Electron app starts.

    The purpose is to prevent unauthorized access to the API (csrf and similar attacks).

    Implemented as a pure ASGI middleware rather than a `BaseHTTPMiddleware`
    subclass: BaseHTTPMiddleware wraps the inner app in an anyio TaskGroup,
    and a client disconnect mid-request surfaces inside that TaskGroup as
    `RuntimeError("No response returned.")` — which Starlette's error
    middleware logs at ERROR level (Starlette issue #1438). Integration
    tests treat any ERROR log as a failure (SCU-703), and Playwright's
    `full_spa_reload` routinely cancels in-flight asset fetches, so the
    BaseHTTPMiddleware variant produced spurious flakes. Pure ASGI
    middleware doesn't introduce a TaskGroup and therefore doesn't have
    this race.
