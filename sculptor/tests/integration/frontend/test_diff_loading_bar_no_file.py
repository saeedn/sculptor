"""Integration test: the diff loading bar must not appear when no file is open.

Regression for SCU-1329 ("Diff loading state appears when I have no file open").
The DiffPanel's top progress bar was gated only on the workspace-level diff
``isFetching`` flag, which is true during any background or forced diff fetch
regardless of whether a file tab is open. As a result the loading bar flashed
over the empty "Open a file to view it" placeholder.

This test holds a forced diff fetch in flight (so ``isFetching`` stays true)
while a file is open — the bar correctly shows — then closes the tab so the
panel falls back to the empty placeholder *without* the fetch completing. The
bar must disappear once no file is open. Before the fix it stayed visible.
