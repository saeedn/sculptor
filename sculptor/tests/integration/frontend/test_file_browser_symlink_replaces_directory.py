"""Reproduce the duplicate-row rendering bug in the Changes tab when a tracked
directory is deleted and replaced with a symlink at the same path.

Reported scenario: a tracked directory (e.g. ``.claude/skills/create-html-mock/``)
was deleted and replaced with a symlink at the same path. The Changes tab in
the File Browser then renders two rows on top of each other, and in dev React
logs:

    Warning: Encountered two children with the same key, ``...``

The duplicate originates in ``useFileTree`` (sculptor/frontend/src/pages/workspace/
panels/fileBrowser/hooks.ts): ``addDeletedFileToTree`` walks the tree to inject
nodes for files reported as deleted in the diff but absent from the file list,
and only matches existing folders by ``n.type === "directory"``. A file at the
same path (the symlink) doesn't match, so a sibling directory is created at the
same path → two TreeNodes share ``node.path`` → the virtualizer's
``key={node.path}`` collides.

Note: this test runs against a production React build, where the duplicate-key
warning is suppressed. We assert on the rendered DOM directly: at most one row
should display ``mydir`` as its name in the changes tree. The buggy state
shows two: one for the symlink file and one for the synthesized parent folder
of the deleted children.
