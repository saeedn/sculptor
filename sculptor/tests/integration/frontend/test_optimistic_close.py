"""Integration tests for optimistic close of workspace tabs.

Verifies:
- When the backend close API fails, the workspace tab reappears and an error
  toast with a Retry button is shown.

Complements the unit-level tests in
`sculptor/frontend/src/common/state/atoms/workspaces.test.ts`, which cover the
state-level behavior (pending-close suppression, error toast atom set on
rejection). This test covers the UI wiring: the toast actually renders.
