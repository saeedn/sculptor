"""Validation tests for the shared Sculptor instance infrastructure.

These tests verify that the session-scoped shared instance, between-test
cleanup, git repo isolation, and fail-fast mechanism all work correctly.
They are a smoke-test for Phase 1 infrastructure; comprehensive coverage
comes during Phase 2 test migration.

NOTE: Tests within a file run in definition order by default.  The "first /
second" test pairs below rely on this ordering.
