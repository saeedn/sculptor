"""Integration tests for fatal startup errors.

Covers the case where the on-disk database is stamped with an alembic revision
the running build does not know about (e.g. after a downgrade). The backend
must treat this as an unrecoverable startup error and exit promptly, so the
Electron main process can render the fatal ``BACKEND_ERROR_PAGE`` via
``BackendStatusBoundary`` instead of leaving the user stuck on the loading
screen.
