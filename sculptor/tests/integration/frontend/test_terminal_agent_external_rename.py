"""Integration test for live propagation of an external terminal-agent rename.

Regression test for SCU-1531: renaming a terminal agent via the ``sculpt`` CLI
(which hits ``PATCH /api/v1/workspaces/{workspace_id}/agents/{agent_id}``)
looked like a no-op in the UI. The new name only appeared after the user
switched tabs, which forced a re-fetch of the agent list.

The cause was server-side: the rename endpoint persisted the new title but
never broadcast a task update to live WebSocket subscribers. Coding agents
masked the bug because their constant message activity piggybacks the fresh
title onto the next broadcast; an idle terminal agent ("no message-queue
subscription, no title generation") never re-broadcasts, so its tab stayed
stale until a tab switch.

This test reproduces the external rename faithfully by issuing the PATCH the
CLI issues and asserting the tab label updates live, with NO tab switch.

The terminal agent is driven to a fully idle state (a shell round-trip) BEFORE
the rename: its one startup task message (``EnvironmentAcquiredRunnerMessage``)
has already been published by then, so an idle terminal produces no further
broadcast that could accidentally carry the new title and mask the bug.
