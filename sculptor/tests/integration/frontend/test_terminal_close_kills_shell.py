"""End-to-end UI test for the terminal-close kill path.

Drives the real frontend in a real browser via Playwright:

1. Opens a workspace, opens the terminal panel.
2. Runs ``echo "PID:$$"`` in the terminal and reads the shell pid out of
   the xterm buffer.
3. Confirms the shell process is alive on the host via ``os.kill(pid, 0)``.
4. Adds a second terminal tab (so closing the first doesn't trigger the
   "last tab => create a fresh replacement" path, which would mask whether
   close actually killed the original shell).
5. Clicks the X close button on the first tab.
6. Polls ``os.kill(pid, 0)`` on the host until it raises
   ``ProcessLookupError`` (or fails the test on timeout) -- proves the
   shell process was actually killed, not just disconnected.
7. Runs a fresh command in the surviving tab to confirm the terminal panel
   is still healthy after a close.

The shell pid lives on the host (everything is in the same process tree)
so this also implicitly exercises whichever pty implementation
LocalTerminalManager is using (currently SpawnedPtyProcess). No code
changes needed here when the underlying pty class swaps.
