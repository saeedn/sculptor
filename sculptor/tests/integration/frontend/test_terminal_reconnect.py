"""Integration test for the terminal reconnecting after its WebSocket drops.

Drives the real reconnect path by capturing and closing the live terminal
socket via the ``terminal_socket_capture`` fixture (Playwright cannot otherwise
drop an established loopback socket). A literal sleep-induced 1006 close is
covered by the unit test; here we exercise the end-to-end recovery against the
real backend, which keeps the PTY alive across the disconnect and replays its
buffer on reconnect.
