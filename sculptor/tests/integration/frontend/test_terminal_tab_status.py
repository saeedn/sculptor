"""Integration tests for the terminal tab connection-state indicator.

These exercise the real frontend chain — a terminal WebSocket closing drives
``useTerminal``'s status, which surfaces as a dot on the terminal tab — by
capturing and closing the live socket via the ``terminal_socket_capture``
fixture (Playwright cannot otherwise drop an established loopback socket).
