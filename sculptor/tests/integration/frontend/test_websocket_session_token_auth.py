"""End-to-end auth test for SCU-1441: the stream WebSocket must enforce the
session token.

Spins up a real Sculptor backend (via the shared ``sculptor_instance_factory_``
machinery) with ``SESSION_TOKEN`` set, then connects to ``/api/v1/stream/ws``
the way the ``sculpt`` CLI does — single-shot: connect, read the initial frame,
disconnect. It connects twice against the same backend:

1. with no token, simulating a drive-by page that cannot obtain it — the
   handshake must be rejected with close code 4401; and
2. with the correct token — the handshake succeeds and the initial state dump
   is delivered.

Before SCU-1441 the middleware passed every non-HTTP scope straight through, so
step 1 would have succeeded and streamed all tasks/projects to an unauthorized
client.

Uses the factory fixture rather than hand-rolling backend startup so that
process spawn, readiness, port allocation, and teardown stay consistent with
the rest of the suite across launch modes. The WebSocket client is the
``websockets`` sync client (no event loop of our own); the CI runner
dispatches each test under its own loop, so an ``async def`` test would fail
with "This event loop is already running".
