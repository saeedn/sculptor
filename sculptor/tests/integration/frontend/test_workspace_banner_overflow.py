"""Integration test for the workspace banner overflow menu (SCU-1372).

When the workspace banner is too narrow to show all of its items, the
progressive-collapse logic hides the lowest-priority items. Previously a "..."
overflow menu appeared in their place whose ``DropdownMenu.Item`` entries had no
``onSelect`` handler — a user could open the menu and click the items, but
nothing happened. They were inert placeholders for an overflow menu that was
never wired up.

This test forces the banner to collapse and asserts that no such inert overflow
menu is shown.
