"""End-to-end tests for the workspace delete + cleanup teardown path.

Deleting a workspace runs a cascade with several moving parts (see
``web/app.py::delete_workspace`` and
``workspace_service/default_implementation.py::delete_workspace``):

1. Cascade-delete every agent/task in the workspace. A *running* task takes the
   cooperative ``is_deleting`` shutdown path (signal the runner, let it finalize
   on exit); an *idle* task is finalized immediately.
2. On a background thread after the soft-delete commits:
   ``stop_terminals_for_environment`` kills any live PTYs *first* (before the
   working directory is torn out from under them — SCU-1424), then
   ``remove_worktree`` removes the git worktree, then the environment directory
   is ``rmtree``'d.
3. The UI removes the workspace tab optimistically.

Other tests cover these pieces in isolation — ``test_worktree_deletion_policies``
removes a worktree with no terminal/agent activity, and
``test_terminal_close_kills_shell`` kills a shell by closing its *tab*, not by
deleting the workspace. Neither deletes a workspace that simultaneously has a
live PTY and an agent and asserts the whole teardown happens. These two tests
close that gap, one per task-finalization path (idle and running).
