"""Integration tests for registering a git worktree as the Sculptor user repo.

Scenario: a user runs Sculptor (e.g. via ``just start``) from inside a git
worktree. That Sculptor instance auto-registers its cwd — the worktree —
as a project. Today, creating a workspace from that project fails
because ``git clone --reference <worktree>`` is rejected by upstream git
("reference repository ... as a linked checkout is not supported yet").

The fix canonicalises worktree paths to their parent repo at registration
time, so the registered project points at a real repository and downstream
operations (worktree creation, branch listing, etc.) work normally.
