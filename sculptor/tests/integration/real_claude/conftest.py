"""Configuration for real Claude integration tests.

These tests run against the real Claude CLI (not a fake agent). They require:
- A real `claude` CLI binary installed and on PATH
- The CLI to be logged in (run ``claude /login`` once to write OAuth
  credentials to ``~/.claude/``). The conftest just stops Sculptor from
  injecting the fake ``sk-HIDDEN-FOR-TESTING`` value so the CLI's normal
  OAuth flow is what authenticates the request.

They are marked with @real_claude and should be run separately from the
regular integration test suite (they are slow and consume Claude usage).

Run with:
    just test-real-claude sculptor/tests/integration/real_claude/

    The default test environment forces ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-HIDDEN-FOR-TESTING"``,
    which would actively block Claude CLI from reaching its OAuth credentials
    at ``~/.claude/``. Passing ``hide_keys=False`` here removes that override
    so the CLI's normal OAuth flow handles auth.

    (``hide_keys=False`` also forwards a real ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` /
    ``~/.anthropic_api_key`` to the backend if either happens to be set,
    but OAuth is the path the team actually uses.)
