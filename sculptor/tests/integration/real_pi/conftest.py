"""Configuration for real pi integration tests.

These tests run against a real ``pi`` CLI (not FakePi) and require:

- The pinned ``pi`` binary installed in the workspace venv via
  ``just install-pi`` (see ``PI_VERSION_RANGE`` in
  ``dependency_management_service``).
- A valid ``ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`` in the environment.

They are marked with ``@pytest.mark.real_pi`` and run via ``just test-real-pi``
(excluded from CI; cost API credits).
