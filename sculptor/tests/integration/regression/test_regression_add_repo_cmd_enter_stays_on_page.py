"""Regression test: Cmd+Enter in the Add Repo dialog should not create a workspace.

Bug: On the Add Workspace page ("Name your workspace"), opening the repo selector
and choosing the add-repository option opens a dialog with a path autocomplete.
Pressing Cmd+Enter there is meant to *add the selected repository* and return to
the Add Workspace page. Instead, the page's global "Cmd+Enter creates the
workspace" listener also fired, so a single Cmd+Enter both added the repo and
created a workspace, navigating the user straight through to the agent chat.

The expected behavior is that Cmd+Enter inside the dialog only adds the repo and
leaves the user on the Add Workspace page.
