"""Regression test: Individual file diff must fetch oldLines from HEAD in
uncommitted scope.

When viewing uncommitted changes (HEAD → working tree), the "old" file
content for hunk expansion must come from HEAD — not from the target branch.
The Changes tab defaults to "All" (vs-target-branch) scope, which correctly
uses the target branch ref.  This test explicitly switches to "Uncommitted"
scope to verify that HEAD is used there.

Without baseRefOverride="HEAD" in the uncommitted scope, useFileLines falls
back to getBaseRef() which returns e.g. "main".  When committed changes on
the workspace branch significantly alter a file's line count vs "main",
Pierre's DiffHunksRenderer crashes with "newLine or oldLine doesnt exist
for context" because the target-branch line array is too short.

This is the same class of bug as the Review All / Shiki regression
(test_regression_review_all_shiki_error.py), but affects the individual file
diff panel rather than the combined review view.
