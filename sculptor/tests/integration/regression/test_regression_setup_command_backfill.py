"""Regression test: enabling the workspace-setup-commands toggle must not
retroactively run setup in workspaces that were created before the toggle.

Bug history: When the toggle was enabled after a workspace already existed,
the legacy implementation injected the setup command into that workspace's
existing PTY on the very next Sculptor restart. The new SetupCommandRunner
records `setup_status` per workspace at creation time; pre-existing rows
are backfilled to `succeeded` (or `not_configured`) by the alembic data
migration, so the runner never auto-fires on them. This test exercises the
end-to-end flow:

1. Start Sculptor with the toggle off; create a workspace.
2. Enable the toggle and configure a workspace setup command.
3. Restart Sculptor.
4. Reopen the pre-existing workspace and assert the setup card never enters
   `running` (the cancel button never appears) — i.e. the command did not
   auto-fire retroactively.

The workspace is created with a terminal agent (no chat / prompt vehicle); the
setup-command run + status card are independent of which agent the workspace
holds.
