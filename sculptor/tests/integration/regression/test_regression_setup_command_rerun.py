"""Regression test: workspace setup must not auto-rerun across Sculptor restarts.

The new SetupCommandRunner records terminal state in the workspace's
setup_status column. After a successful run we persist `succeeded`; on app
restart, the lifespan reconciler should leave that row alone (only `running`
rows are converted to `failed`). Manual rerun via the SetupStatusCard's
button still works.

The workspace is created with a terminal agent (no chat / prompt vehicle); the
setup-command run + status card are independent of which agent the workspace
holds.
