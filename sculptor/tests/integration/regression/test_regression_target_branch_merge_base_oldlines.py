"""Regression test (SCU-1371): vs-target-branch diff must fetch oldLines from
the merge-base commit, not the target-branch tip.

The "All" scope renders ``targetBranchDiff``, which the backend computes as a
three-dot diff against ``merge-base(target, HEAD)`` — so the hunks' old-side
line numbers reference the *merge-base* content.  ``useFileLines``, however,
fetched ``oldLines`` from the target-branch *tip* (e.g. ``main``).

Those two refs only agree when the target branch has not modified the file
since the branch point.  When ``main`` shortens the file after the branch
point, the tip content is shorter than the old-side line numbers the merge-base
diff references, so Pierre's context-expansion indexes past the end of the
(shorter) ``oldLines`` array and renderHunks throws::

    renderHunks: oldLine and newLine are null, something is wrong

This is the same crash class as ``test_regression_review_all_shiki_error*`` and
``test_regression_large_diff_crash`` — but those exercised the scope→ref
selection (HEAD vs target branch).  They still fetched the target-branch *tip*,
so this merge-base-vs-tip case stayed latent until the target branch itself
diverged.

Strategy
--------
``src/helpers.py`` is 75 lines on ``main`` (the merge-base at branch time).
The default worktree workspace branches off ``main``, so ``main`` is its target
branch.  The agent:

1. Shrinks ``src/helpers.py`` to 25 lines and commits it on the workspace
   branch.  The vs-target-branch diff (merge-base → working tree) is then a
   two-hunk diff whose context gap references old-side lines well past line 25.
2. Advances ``main`` to a divergent commit (parented on the original
   merge-base) whose ``src/helpers.py`` is a single line.  Crucially this keeps
   ``merge-base(HEAD, main)`` at the original 75-line commit, so the diff is
   unchanged — only the *tip* content shrinks.

With the bug, ``useFileLines`` fetches ``oldLines`` from the 1-line tip and
Pierre crashes.  The fix fetches ``oldLines`` from the 75-line merge-base
commit, so the read-file-at-ref request uses the merge-base SHA (a 40-char
hex commit id) instead of the ``main`` branch name.
