"""Regression test: terminal text must stay legible in light mode.

In light mode, terminal output that uses the ANSI "white" / "bright white"
palette entries — e.g. the *context* (unmodified) lines in a Claude Code
file-write update block — rendered white-on-white and was impossible to read.
The cause: ``buildTerminalTheme`` set only ``foreground``/``background``/etc.
and never overrode the 16 ANSI palette colors, so xterm.js fell back to its
built-in palette, which is tuned for a dark background (``white`` ≈ #d3d7cf,
``brightWhite`` ≈ #eeeeec). Against the light-mode panel background those two
entries have almost no contrast.

This asserts the light-mode theme defines an ANSI palette whose white-family
entries have real contrast against the background. It reads the xterm theme
*config object* (``xterm.options.theme.white`` etc.), the same behavioural
signal the sibling ``test_regression_terminal_theme_toggle.py`` reads for the
background color — not a rendered/computed style.

Distinct from ``test_regression_terminal_theme_toggle.py`` (which covers the
terminal *background* updating on theme toggle); both live in the same xterm
theme/palette code.
