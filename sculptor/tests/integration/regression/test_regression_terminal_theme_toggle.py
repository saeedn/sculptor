"""Regression test: terminal theme must update when the app theme is toggled.

Pressing Cmd+Shift+D (Meta+Shift+D) toggles the UI between dark and light mode.
The terminal (xterm.js) theme should also update to match.  A previous bug caused
the terminal to keep its old colors because the background color was read from the
DOM via getComputedStyle, which could return stale CSS variable values when the
Radix theme transition was still in progress.
