"""Regression test: workspace peek overlay stuck after middle-click closing the last tab.

When the user hovers a workspace tab to open the peek popover, then
middle-clicks the tab to close it (while Home or Settings is open),
the popover must be dismissed.  Previously, the popover stayed visible
permanently because only left-click fired the dismiss handler.
