"""Harness (agent-type) selection for ``sculpt agent create``.

Mirrors the harness chooser the UI shows: the built-in Terminal type plus
any registered terminal agents (for example "Claude CLI"). When no harness is
requested the CLI sends nothing and lets the server apply the user's
most-recently-used choice from the Sculptor app — falling back to the bundled
``claude-code`` terminal agent when there is none — so ``sculpt`` keeps no
harness state of its own.
